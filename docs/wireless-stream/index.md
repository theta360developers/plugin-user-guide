# Overview

The Wireless Live Streaming plug-in allows a THETA V to stream 4K 360° video directly to YouTube Live Events, Facebook Live 360 or Periscope Live 360. No mobile phone or laptop is required. The THETA V connects to the Internet using WiFi and will stream the 360 video directly to a service such as YouTube.

The plug-in has also been reported to work with Ethernet using
USB OTG Ethernet adapters. If you get live streaming over
Ethernet working, please send us a report of your USB OTG adapter
and we'll add it to the guide.

The plug-in is available from the THETA Store (LINK). Source code for the plug-in is  available from GitHub (LINK). This guide covers the use of the apk from the THETA Store to connect to YouTube Live Events and use 360° video.
