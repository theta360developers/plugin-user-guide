Easily put 360° Live Events on your Facebook timeline or corporate
Page.  Stream directly from the THETA V with Wi-Fi. No other device 
is needed.

## Create Facebook Live Event

Go to https://www.facebook.com/live/create

![facebook live event](/wireless-stream/img/facebook/flive.png)

You will see the *Connect* page. Although the blue button
is tempting to press right now, hold on for just a second. You need to set the
event to 360°.

![facebook connect](/wireless-stream/img/facebook/connect.png)

Go to the *Settings* panel. Go to *360 VIDEO*.

Make sure you've checked, *Broadcast this as a spherical video*.

Select *360 Video - Standard*.

## Configure THETA

You need to copy the Server URL and Persistent Stream Key from
Facebook into your THETA web-based configuration tool.  Make sure
the Server URL starts with **live-360**.  Start the stream, either
by pressing the button in the web browser or pressing the physical
shutter button on the camera.

## Start Event

Preview the event to make sure it is in 360°. You will see
the 360° directional indicator in the right of the panel.

The front view is the directly opposite the rear lens that is
opposite of the shutter button on the camera.

Do to low upstream bandwidth, I am streaming only at 720p, not 
at the 4K the THETA V is capable of.

Invite specific friends or make your Facebook Live 360°
Event open to the public.

Engage with your audience.

Note that audio is single channel only right now.  This
is the screenshot from Jesse Casman's workstation in 
San Francisco. I'm talking to him using the THETA 
internal microphone from Palo Alto.
