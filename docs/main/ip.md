# Find IP Address of THETA V

To configure some plug-ins, you will need to find the IP address of your THETA V when
it is connected to the Internet.

For example, you will need to the IP address of the THETA to configure both
the Wireless Live Streaming and File Cloud Upload plug-ins using a web browser. 
In this example, I am using Chrome. You can use any browser. 

You can use the THETA mobile app to find the IP address of the THETA V. You 
need to connect the app to the THETA V using client mode. Here is a 
[step-by-step guide to connect your THETA V and your mobile phone with client mode](https://community.theta360.guide/t/theta-v-client-mode-configuration-guide/2565). 
Ricoh also has an excellent 
[video on using Wireless LAN Client Mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkqyBNOWWIY). 
Steps to configure the THETA V for client mode using WPS is covered in 
[this video](https://youtu.be/0djxUbn13kM) from the community.

The Authentication settings password is used by the mobile app to connect to the THETA. By default, this is the numerical ID of the THETA V serial number. If the THETA V serial number on the bottom of the camera is THETAYL123456789 then the password is 123456789.

In the mobile app, the IP address of your THETA is in 

*Settings -> Camera settings - Camera version*

In addition to the method above, you can find the IP address assigned to your camera using many
other methods described in the main [troubleshooting](/main/troubleshoot) section.
