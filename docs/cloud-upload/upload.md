following:

2. THETA is in plug-in mode and there is a solid white LED above the shutter button
3. THETA V is connected to Internet. If your LED is flashing blue, press the Wi-Fi button on the side of the camera. The Wi-Fi LED will flash green initially, then be solid green when the connection is established
4. Your plug-in is authorized with your Google Account.
