# Overview

The Cloud Upload plug-in uploads still images directly from
the RICOH THETA to Google Photos using Wi-Fi. The upload
process can be started by either using the shutter button
of the camera or by using a web-based upload manager.

Prior to your first upload, you need to register your
THETA with Google Photos to ensure secure uploads. 
Initial configuration and upload are described in this document.

Your 360 images can be rotated within Google Photos.
