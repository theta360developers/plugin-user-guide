# Dual-Fisheye and Fast Bracketing Plug-in

The Dual-Fisheye and Fast Bracketing plug-in allows you to take a single dual-fisheye or bracketed 360 degree images more quickly, delaying the stitching for batch processing at a later time. 

The Dual-Fisheye and Fast Bracketing plug-in can take 3 separate photos with only 1 click of the shutter button. The process takes approximately 3 seconds, compared to 12 seconds for the standard bracketing function of the THETA V. Each photo is a different exposure: 1 is a bit bright, 1 a bit darker, and 1 just about right (EV0 +/-2). The result is a crisper, brighter final 360 degree image. 

In single picture mode, a picture takes about 1 second, which can save significant time if you are taking hundreds or thousands of pictures for tasks such as building documentation.  

To speed up the process, the Dual-Fisheye and Fast Bracketing Plug-in keeps the two 180 degree fisheye images unstitched and sends them over to an Android device for batch processing later. 

The Dual-Fisheye and Fast Bracketing Plug-in comes with a free calibration app, so that when you stitch the 2 halves together - at some later time, most likely in batch processing, but it can be for single images - the 2 halves will be closely aligned for your completed bracketed images. You only need to do the calibration once, and after that the parameters of your camera will be remembered. The configuration takes about 30 seconds per camera. The user needs to click on three sets of points. Auto-leveling of the images does not work currently, but this can easily be handled in the calibration app as well.

The stitching library for the Dual-Fisheye and Fast Bracketing Plug-in can be purchased separately.
